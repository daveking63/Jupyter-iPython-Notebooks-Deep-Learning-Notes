# Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes
Summary bibliography and notes from a variety of recent book chapters and articles dealing with Deep Learning, TensorFlow and Keras.

This summary focuses on various bibliographical sources (book chapters, articles, tutorials, and iPython notebooks) focused on understanding, building, testing and training deep learning models using primarily TensorFlow and Keras. When possible, each source details access to existing iPython notebooks that can be executed on either Jupyter.org's <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">nbviewer</a> or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google's Colab</a>. Additionally, and primarily for my own edification, I've also provided access to my own notes for selected parts of the sources. These notes can also be view on either nbviewer or Colab. 

This summary contains bibliographical sources, pointers to existing code (including iPython .ipynb> notebooks), and notes that I've created using either iPython or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google's Colab</a>.

In a github repository, <i>.ipynb</i> (iPython) notebooks are rendered as static files. There are a variety of ways to access the interactive features of a notebook in a repository. One way is to set up a local notebook server (e.g. on your laptop) and download the notebook of interest to this server. Another is to use <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org">Jupyter's web-based <i>nbviewer</i></a> to render the notebook. This is done by simply entering the url of the .ipynb notebook of interest on the site. 

For the notebooks in this repository, the following urls will activate the designated notebooks:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daveking63/Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/master/notes_predictive_analytics_with_tensorflow-ch-3-7.ipynb

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daveking63/Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/master/notes_from_mastering_predictive_analytics_Ch4-5-Manning.ipynb

Finally, some of the notebooks are rendered via Google's "Colaboratory", or “Colab” for short. "Colab is a product from Google Research that enables anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education." More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

Those repository files that have been created in Colab are denoted as as such in the file listing on the opening page of the repository.  In order to access any of these files, simply click on the filename. At this point, the file contents will be display with a button at the top that will open the notebook in Colab. Currently, there are two files of this sort: 'DLPython2ndCh3.ipynb' and 'DLPython2ndCh4.ipynb'.
