# Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes
Summary bibliography and notes from a variety of recent book chapters and articles dealing with Deep Learning, TensorFlow and Keras.

(In process)

This summary focuses on various introductory bibliographical sources (book chapters, articles, tutorials, and iPython notebooks) focused on "getting started" with understanding, building, testing and training deep learning models using primarily TensorFlow and Keras. When possible, each source details access to existing iPython notebooks that can be executed on either Jupyter.org's <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">nbviewer</a> or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google's Colab</a>. Additionally, and primarily for my own edification, I've also provided access to my own notes for selected parts of the sources. These notes can also be view on either nbviewer or Colab. 

This summary contains bibliographical sources, pointers to existing code (including iPython .ipynb> notebooks), and notes that I've created using either iPython or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google's Colab</a>.
