# Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes
Summary notes from a variety of recent book chapters and articles dealing with Deep Learning and TensorFlow

This repository contains my summarized notes and examples from a range of book chapters, as well as tutorial articles, dealing with building, testing and training deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. Many of these are already available in detailed form on github. Currently, my notes from the following sources are included:

<ul>
<li>Chapters 3 and 7 from Md. Rezaul Karim's Predictive Analytics with TensorFlow (2017 Packt Publishing). The original code and notebooks can be found at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Predictive-Analytics-with-TensorFlow.</li>
<li>Chapters 4 and 5 from Alan Fontaine's Mastering Predictive Analytics with scikit-learn and TensorFlow (2018 Packt Publishing). The original code and notebooks can be found at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Predictive-Analytics-with-scikit-learn-and-TensorFlow.</li>
<li>Chapter 3 and 4 from Francois Chollet's Deep Learning with Python (2020 Manning Publication). This book is only available in draft form from Manning. The code for the original version of this book is found at https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks (although many of the examples in the new version are close to the original.</li>
</ul>

In a github repository, <i>.ipynb</i> (iPython) notebooks are rendered as static files. There are a variety of ways to access the interactive features of a notebook in a repository. One way is to set up a local notebook server (e.g. on your laptop) and download the notebook of interest to this server. Another is to use <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org">Jupyter's web-based <i>nbviewer</i></a> to render the notebook. This is done by simply entering the url of the .ipynb notebook of interest on the site. 

For the notebooks in this repository, the following urls will activate the designated notebooks:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daveking63/Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/master/notes_predictive_analytics_with_tensorflow-ch-3-7.ipynb

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daveking63/Jupyter-iPython-Notebooks-Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/master/notes_from_mastering_predictive_analytics_Ch4-5-Manning.ipynb

Finally, some of the notebooks are rendered via Google's "Colaboratory", or “Colab” for short. "Colab is a product from Google Research that enables anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education." More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

Those repository files that have been created in Colab are denoted as as such in the file listing on the opening page of the repository.  In order to access any of these files, simply click on the filename. At this point, the file contents will be display with a button at the top that will open the notebook in Colab. Currently, there are two files of this sort: 'DLPython2ndCh3.ipynb' and 'DLPython2ndCh4.ipynb'.
